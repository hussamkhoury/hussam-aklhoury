## 👋 About Me

I am an AI Engineer with a strong backend and full-stack engineering background, focused on building **production-grade AI systems** rather than demos. My work centers on **LLM-powered applications**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **agent-based architectures**, with a strong emphasis on clean design, scalability, and real-world usability.

I have hands-on experience designing and deploying AI systems on **Google Cloud Platform**, working across the full lifecycle: from data ingestion and document intelligence, to model integration, backend APIs, and cloud deployment.

I enjoy solving complex problems where **AI meets system design**, and I care deeply about maintainability, observability, and long-term evolution of software systems.
